# Climate-Source Weather App 
This project is a weather application built using React.js, designed to display current weather information for a specified city. It utilizes the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data and dynamically updates the UI based on the retrieved information.

# **Features**
**Dynamic Weather Display:** The app fetches and displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon for a user-input city.
**Search Functionality:** Users can enter a city name in the search bar and click the search icon to fetch weather data for that city.
**Error Handling**: Alerts are shown for invalid city inputs or failed API requests to ensure smooth user experience.
**Responsive Design:** The UI is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.


# Technologies Used
React: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
JavaScript (ES6+): Used for logic and data manipulation.
CSS: Styling the components and layout.
WeatherAPI: External API used for fetching weather data.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
